# Simple TODO

Very simple todo syntax file. I prefer to keep todos/notes on a per
project basis. 

This plugins does TWO things:

* Dim out lines marked with ```x``` (being done)
* Mark lines green that are marked with ```c``` (being current)

## TODO

Some stuff that I'd still like to add at some point

* Simple highlighting/whatever for notes and subs
* Automatic insertion of TODO on line one for reminding me it's a todo
  file. (yes.)
* Some bindings for easier management
